I hope, this will be my permanent blog for writing thoughts about my work process.
Some-times it will be in Russian, but I want to practice my skylls, so some entries will be
in English.
About be in short: I'm a back-end developer here :http://evrone.com. My current language is Ruby
and framework is Rails but I also have 3 years experience in Java and GWT.
After my switch from past work I decided to change as much, as I can. So, instead of Java is Ruby;
GWT was succeeded by Rails and Eclipse was downgraded (upgraded?) to vim (MacVim in my case).

Welcome onboard camarad! Greetings from Soviet Russia. =)
